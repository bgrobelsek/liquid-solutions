This is a simple HTML/CSS website, it's a part of my University Web Applications project. 

<p>
For the animation - I downloaded this youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/lH6qlF_iegU">video</a>, trimmed it, compressed it to a lower quality and it used is
as a background image for all pages. Every time you click a link the animation resets. The web page is really simple, I just followed the instructions given to us on how the website should look.
